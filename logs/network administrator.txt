FORA is being developed using an Agile approach, which encourages collaborative effort between the product development team and their customer(s) / end user(s) FORA is being developed using an Agile approach, which encourages collaborative effort between the product development team and their customer(s) / end user(s) The first half day of every Sprint is the Planning cycle. The Client Business/Solution analyst composes a list of eligible stories and bugs from the backlog list for this Sprint. The Client Product Owner confirms the goals for the sprint and approves the priorities on the stories/bugs proposed for the Sprint. The Vendor and Client developers are present to provide their estimate of effort in Story Points for each proposed story/bug. The Client Product Owner approves the Sprint. The Vendor and Client developer and testing teams review the Sprint for resourcing and tasks to optimize assignments. The Client Development Lead reviews the stories and assigns the component tasks to the Vendor and Client developers, e.g. front-end, back-end, database. The Vendor and Client developers draw from the assignments and completes the coding and unit testing. The Vendor and Client developers work closely with all Project Team members and business SMEs during the coding. When coding is completed, the story/bug is then reviewed by the Client Development Lead for quality and compliance with the design. The Client Testing Lead reviews the story/bug and assigns it for functional testing. An automated test script to be developed by the Vendor for future release regression testing. Any bugs identified will be documented and turned back to the developer for mitigation. When functional testing is successful, then the story/bug is reviewed by the Client Business/Solution analyst and the SMEs. Any defects are identified as a bug and returned to the developer for correction and re-testing. If accepted by the Client, then it is moved to the Done bucket for that Sprint. At the end of the Sprint, there is a formal Review session with the Client Product Owner in which the Client Development Lead outlines the stories/bugs completed and receives formal acceptance by the Client Product Owner. The final session for the Sprint is a Retrospective with the Client and Vendor teams to identify the positive and improvements for each area, e.g. development, testing, UI, requirements, DevOps, management, and project management. These are all documented by Sprint in the DevOps tool. The Sprint is formally closed. Outcome statistics and results are shared with Vendor and Client management.

The Client Business/Solution analyst composes a list of eligible stories and bugs from the backlog list for this Sprint. The Client Product Owner confirms the goals for the sprint and approves the priorities on the stories/bugs proposed for the Sprint. The Vendor and Client developers are present to provide their estimate of effort in Story Points for each proposed story/bug. The Client Product Owner approves the Sprint. The Vendor and Client developer and testing teams review the Sprint for resourcing and tasks to optimize assignments. The Client Development Lead reviews the stories and assigns the component tasks to the Vendor and Client developers, e.g. front-end, back-end, database. The Vendor and Client developers draw from the assignments and completes the coding and unit testing. The Vendor and Client developers work closely with all Project Team members and business SMEs during the coding. When coding is completed, the story/bug is then reviewed by the Client Development Lead for quality and compliance with the design. The Client Testing Lead reviews the story/bug and assigns it for functional testing. An automated test script to be developed by the Vendor for future release regression testing. Any bugs identified will be documented and turned back to the developer for mitigation. When functional testing is successful, then the story/bug is reviewed by the Client Business/Solution analyst and the SMEs. Any defects are identified as a bug and returned to the developer for correction and re-testing. If accepted by the Client, then it is moved to the Done bucket for that Sprint. At the end of the Sprint, there is a formal Review session with the Client Product Owner in which the Client Development Lead outlines the stories/bugs completed and receives formal acceptance by the Client Product Owner. The final session for the Sprint is a Retrospective with the Client and Vendor teams to identify the positive and improvements for each area, e.g. development, testing, UI, requirements, DevOps, management, and project management. These are all documented by Sprint in the DevOps tool. The Sprint is formally closed. Outcome statistics and results are shared with Vendor and Client management.

The Client Testing Lead reviews the story/bug and assigns it for functional testing. An automated test script to be developed by the Vendor for future release regression testing. Any bugs identified will be documented and turned back to the developer for mitigation. When functional testing is successful, then the story/bug is reviewed by the Client Business/Solution analyst and the SMEs. Any defects are identified as a bug and returned to the developer for correction and re-testing. If accepted by the Client, then it is moved to the Done bucket for that Sprint. At the end of the Sprint, there is a formal Review session with the Client Product Owner in which the Client Development Lead outlines the stories/bugs completed and receives formal acceptance by the Client Product Owner. The final session for the Sprint is a Retrospective with the Client and Vendor teams to identify the positive and improvements for each area, e.g. development, testing, UI, requirements, DevOps, management, and project management.

The Client Business/Solution analyst composes a list of eligible stories and bugs from the backlog list for this Sprint. The Client Product Owner confirms the goals for the sprint and approves the priorities on the stories/bugs proposed for the Sprint. The Vendor and Client developers are present to provide their estimate of effort in Story Points for each proposed story/bug. The Client Product Owner approves the Sprint. The Vendor and Client developer and testing teams review the Sprint for resourcing and tasks to optimize assignments. The Client Development Lead reviews the stories and assigns the component tasks to the Vendor and Client developers, e.g. front-end, back-end, database. The Vendor and Client developers draw from the assignments and completes the coding and unit testing. The Vendor and Client developers work closely with all Project Team members and business SMEs during the coding. When coding is completed, the story/bug is then reviewed by the Client Development Lead for quality and compliance with the design. The Client Testing Lead reviews the story/bug and assigns it for functional testing. An automated test script to be developed by the Vendor for future release regression testing. Any bugs identified will be documented and turned back to the developer for mitigation. When functional testing is successful, then the story/bug is reviewed by the Client Business/Solution analyst and the SMEs. Any defects are identified as a bug and returned to the developer for correction and re-testing. If accepted by the Client, then it is moved to the Done bucket for that Sprint. At the end of the Sprint, there is a formal Review session with the Client Product Owner in which the Client Development Lead outlines the stories/bugs completed and receives formal acceptance by the Client Product Owner. The final session for the Sprint is a Retrospective with the Client and Vendor teams to identify the positive and improvements for each area, e.g. development, testing, UI, requirements, DevOps, management, and project management. These are all documented by Sprint in the DevOps tool. The Sprint is formally closed. Outcome statistics and results are shared with Vendor and Client management.
