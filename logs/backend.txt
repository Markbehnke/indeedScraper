Initial call to make sure you think the position/company is a fit for you. Fraction is a Series A startup, so you have to want to work at a small, rapidly growing company. There might be a small systems-design technical question, but there's no need to prepare for it. Take-home challenge. Takes time, we know, but our hope is that it a) it more closely shows how you actually produce work, and b) it is our replacement for the painful all-day onsite that lots of companies do. Takes anywhere from 3-8 hours depending on your speed, so we give people a week to do it. Somewhat unique (as far as we know) is that we actually have every single person in the company across all departments do a take-home challenge. We give you the option to do a backend challenge or a frontend challenge - your preference. Frontend is written in React, backend we've provided a template with NodeJS but you can use any number of language - again, your preference. We used to have a full-stack challenge, but honestly it just took too long for people to complete, so we retired it. A quick call to go over your take-home, this is your opportunity to brag about the things you built in the challenge. If there are any issues in the challenge that we noticed, we will try to suss out if you are able to figure out what those issues are. A final culture/values interview with the co-founders. This is a chance for you to get some face-time with each of the founders to get a feel for the vision we are trying to enact and to make sure it resonates with you. An event system for managing asynchronous workflows. A payments system to enable Fraction's customers to make and receive payments. A dashboard for customers to interact with our platform, and another dashboard for our internal operations team to automate their workflows. A year of experience. If you are a new grad, your internships/co-ops count toward this! Frontend or backend: we are hiring for all types of engineers. Although our stack is all Typescript, if you are backend-focused, we don't require experience with it (if you are frontend, we do expect you'll have experience with React, as it is part of our take-home challenge and you'd be unlikely to complete it successfully without that experience). You own your work. We are a young startup, so each and every person has a massive impact on the success of the company. With great power comes great responsibility.

Initial call to make sure you think the position/company is a fit for you. Fraction is a Series A startup, so you have to want to work at a small, rapidly growing company. There might be a small systems-design technical question, but there's no need to prepare for it. Take-home challenge. Takes time, we know, but our hope is that it a) it more closely shows how you actually produce work, and b) it is our replacement for the painful all-day onsite that lots of companies do. Takes anywhere from 3-8 hours depending on your speed, so we give people a week to do it. Somewhat unique (as far as we know) is that we actually have every single person in the company across all departments do a take-home challenge. We give you the option to do a backend challenge or a frontend challenge - your preference. Frontend is written in React, backend we've provided a template with NodeJS but you can use any number of language - again, your preference. We used to have a full-stack challenge, but honestly it just took too long for people to complete, so we retired it. A quick call to go over your take-home, this is your opportunity to brag about the things you built in the challenge. If there are any issues in the challenge that we noticed, we will try to suss out if you are able to figure out what those issues are. A final culture/values interview with the co-founders. This is a chance for you to get some face-time with each of the founders to get a feel for the vision we are trying to enact and to make sure it resonates with you. An event system for managing asynchronous workflows. A payments system to enable Fraction's customers to make and receive payments. A dashboard for customers to interact with our platform, and another dashboard for our internal operations team to automate their workflows. A year of experience. If you are a new grad, your internships/co-ops count toward this! Frontend or backend: we are hiring for all types of engineers. Although our stack is all Typescript, if you are backend-focused, we don't require experience with it (if you are frontend, we do expect you'll have experience with React, as it is part of our take-home challenge and you'd be unlikely to complete it successfully without that experience). You own your work. We are a young startup, so each and every person has a massive impact on the success of the company. With great power comes great responsibility.

Having a say: You’ll participate in the problem definition and solution process with a diverse group of people across engineering, product and the company as a whole. Proper engineering: You’ll mainly write in Node and Typescript/ES6 (i.e. Javascript). You should be familiar with not only best coding practices, but also tricks and quirks of running in multiple versions of web browsers. Experience in writing robust code that has run in a variety of real-time environments is an added bonus, as is experience in frontend frameworks such as React or Angular. Making a difference: We support both our external publisher users and our internal stakeholders, in optimizing and enhancing our platform and tooling capabilities in support of their changing workflows. Technical heavy lifting: You’ll not only be key contributor but you’ll have many opportunities to directly architect features, services, and backend integrations with internal and third party systems, data pipelines and data stores. We’re a team of curious minds, and we work with our other engineering teams very closely while also pursuing various proof of concepts and thought experiments. Deploying code on your first day: We push to production on every commit to our master branches via our continuous integration and deployment pipeline. You’ve shipped software: You should have a strong solid foundation in ECMAScript and ideally Node.js. Any familiarity with Nest.js, which serves as the foundation for most of our applications and services, is an added bonus though not expected. Ideally you should be familiar with an MVC. Experience in frontend frameworks such as React or Angular, in particular, would be helpful.

You want to derive meaning from what you do: Every engineer here is excited to understand what problem they’re solving, why they’re solving it and who they’re solving it for. Values-driven culture: You’d be walking into a welcoming and diverse environment that is built around action, curiosity, purpose, transparency. We have a fun, supportive culture, and firmly believe in what we’re doing. Marry the problem, not the solution: We’re constantly re-evaluating our technical infrastructure to deliver faster, better, and more reliable software.
