You will receive periodic system-generated e-mails advising that your application will expire in a certain number of days, and asking you to log in to your GC Jobs account to resubmit your application. It is important that you monitor your e-mail and resubmit your application when prompted, or your application will be removed from the inventory. This ensures that the information that is provided to hiring managers is current and up-to-date, as well as ensuring that the candidates in the inventory are still interested in employment. You can click on the link in the e-mail to access your account, and you will have a message informing you that your application is set to expire. Click on “Update My Inventory Status” to resubmit your application. To apply for any position, you need to first create a profile in the Public Service Resourcing System (PSRS), which should only take about 10 minutes. Then, after ensuring you meet the position requirements, scroll to the bottom of the poster and click on "Apply online." Work your way through the list of requirements, completing each section and saving as you go. Before submitting your application, please ensure that there are green check marks on every single category before submitting your application. If there are any red Xs on the categories, please click into that category and ensure that everything has been filled out. Screening questions have been built into the application process and occasionally an applicant may miss a field on the Screening Questions page. Please thoroughly review to ensure that you have responded to each question, including all the "Yes / No " questions. PSRS will automatically disconnect candidates without warning after 60 minutes if there is no activity. You need to save or move to a new screen to maintain your connection. Typing information without saving does not prevent you from being disconnected. Applicants may find it helpful to first use a word processing software to complete their responses using concrete and detailed examples, then copy and paste the responses into PSRS afterwards. If you have further questions on how to apply or experience technical difficulties with your application, please visit the following website: http://www.cfp-psc.gc.ca/contact-jobs/index-eng.php We will only accept on-line applications received via the Public Service Jobs site. Persons with disabilities or residing in locations that prevent them from applying on-line are asked to contact 1-800-645-5605. You can choose to update your application when you resubmit it to the inventory, or anytime that something changes that will impact your application. For example, if you gain more experience in an area that is related to the qualifications outlined in the inventory, it would be beneficial to update your application to reflect this. Since hiring managers screen applications based on the information you provided in the screening questions, it is recommended that you include experience gained after you initially submitted your application to ensure they have all of the relevant information. This also applies to changes in your education level, locations or positions you are interested in, or any of the answers you provided to the screening questions. Screening criteria is established to determine which candidates will qualify for further consideration and assessment. During the screening stage, the screening board will review your application to determine if you meet the essential education and essential experiences. However, some managers may opt to use asset education and asset experiences as well. This is why it is essential to provide concrete examples. If you are a candidate that has been “screened-in,” this means that you may undergo further assessment to determine if you meet the other essential and/or asset criteria (i.e. knowledge, abilities, competencies, etc.). Managers can use a combination of assessment methods they deem relevant. Some common assessment methods are written exams, interviews, and reference checks. However, managers have the flexibility to use role-play, simulations, and performance / talent management considerations as part of their assessment. When candidates are invited to the assessment stage, they will be notified of the qualifications being assessed and the assessment method (interview, written take home test, etc.). To help you prepare for assessment, you should think about examples that will best highlight how you meet the qualifications being assessed. During the assessment, use the “STAR” method to best explain your example. STAR stands for the following: Situation: Think of a situation in which you are/were involved. Task: Describe the tasks involved in the situation. Action: Specify what actions you took to achieve your results. Results: What results followed due to your actions? List them and describe each one briefly. Each board will have specific criteria to assess and each pull from the inventory may be treated separately, therefore if you are referred for more than one opportunity you may be re-assessed on the same criteria. Based on the hiring division’s needs, additional essential qualifications, asset qualifications, organizational needs, operational requirements and/or conditions of employment may be identified and applied during the assessment and/or selection of candidates. In assessing candidates, assessment boards may use a variety of tools and methods including, but not limited to, reviews of past performance and accomplishments, written tests, interviews, simulations, PSC tests, reference checks, board member knowledge etc. In addition, all information obtained throughout the selection process, from the time of application to close of process, may be used to evaluate the candidates. Candidates must meet the essential qualifications to be appointed to a position. Depending on the number of applicants, needs and/or plans, volume management strategies such as, but not limited to, top-down approach, cut-off scores, asset selection, random selection and/or assessment may be used for the purpose of managing applications/candidates and/or determining which candidates will continue in the staffing process. Should a volume management strategy be used, communication regarding the application of the strategy will be provided to those candidates who are impacted. Persons are entitled to participate in the appointment process in the official language of their choice. Applicants are asked to indicate their preferred official language in their application. Appointment decisions may be based on one or more of the following criteria: Candidates from outside the federal public service may be required to pay for travel and relocation costs associated with this selection process. Proof of education will be required. Candidates with foreign credentials must provide proof of Canadian equivalency. Consult the Canadian Information Centre for International Credentials for further information at http://www.cicic.ca. Acknowledgment of receipt of applications will not be sent. Candidates will be contacted by email and it is imperative that you provide a current email address that accepts e-mail from unknown users (some email systems block these types of email). It is also the candidate's responsibility to ensure accurate information is provided and updated as required. Candidates are strongly encouraged to check their email on a regular basis. It is your entire responsibility to inform us at all times of any changes regarding your contact information.

You have the ability to solve problems, not just to complete tasks; you consider yourself a craftsperson, not an assembly line worker. You empathize with those who use what you’ve built, because you care about solving their problems. You have strong technical chops, but can also describe technical things to non-technical people. You can tell a ten-year-old how an API works and not have them glaze over with boredom. Or a CEO. Or your significant other. OK, maybe not your significant other. You have a diverse background. Volunteer as a Big Sister? Founded a Meetup? Love to paint? Play a sport? We love diversity and value how much it adds to our team. You have a thirst for learning. We learn something every day, and we find it intoxicating. If you’d rather master one thing and do that every day, this probably isn’t the role for you. You have thoughtful opinions and are comfortable sharing them. We have a culture that makes sharing opinions safe. If everyone in a meeting always thinks the same way, we have too many people in that meeting. You have the ability to give more than you take. We have an incredible team. We want you to make it even better. You are a Java guru and love building high performing, reliable applications (bonus points for familiarity with other languages; Python especially is a plus). You understand the importance of code reviews and writing clean, maintainable code. You’ve used git at the command line and have felt the pain of merge conflicts. You believe in automated testing and can explain why it’s so important. You have experience on AWS and have created a “Hello World” serverless API. You’ve built software of some kind to solve a problem in your life outside of work. You are interested in image processing (have you wondered, How does Photoshop work?). You are interested in, or have experience with, geospatial and remote sensing technologies (e.g., GDAL or SNAP), and the term “normalized difference vegetation index” piques your curiosity. We offer a great compensation package including a competitive base salary, stock options, and a comprehensive benefits plan for you, and your family. We have flexible work hours and flexible remote working options. New employees receive 3 weeks of paid vacation minimum each year, not including paid time-off between Christmas and New Year’s Day (we call them ‘SkyWatch Days’). Our HQ is, in normal times, located in Uptown Waterloo, at the Communitech Data Hub surrounded by other awesome Startups focused on Data, AI, Machine Learning, and IOT. Currently, we operate on a remote-first model with all employees working from home until our situation improves. Effective January 1st 2022, we’ll be moving to our new building on 8 Queen St. in Kitchener, ON. We “Hack the Sky” (our internal hackathon), teaming up with our peers for 36 hours to build something awesome that doesn’t pertain to our normal day to day work. Leave your ego at the door.

Do Something Big: The future promises a lot—the Internet of Everything, smart connected cities, transparent markets, virtual medicine—but these advances require more than what's possible with conventional solutions. We’ve developed a new way to build distributed systems. For over a decade, we’ve used it to build complex trading systems for the world’s largest financial institutions, and now we’re starting to solve real-time problems across every industry. Blaze Your Own Trail: We’re at an exciting stage—small but growing fast. There are unprecedented opportunities to learn and lead right away. Whatever your goals, from heads-down development to collaborating with customers, from executing and streamlining our business to leading teams, from innovating new products to opening up new industries, or a bit of “all of the above", we’ll work together to get you there. There is no one path. You’ll have the freedom to follow your interests as they evolve. Solve Hard Problems: The engineering we do is complex—thousands of globally distributed components, vast amounts of fast-moving shared data, continuous real-time analysis and execution, always-on mission-critical performance. It ordinarily takes years to solve these problems (think aerospace or flight control) but that’s not an option for us. Our fintech executes hundreds of billions of dollars in trades each day, so there’s huge value in launching ideas fast. We invent smarter designs and smarter ways to develop and test, so we can innovate in quick cycles without compromising the exacting requirements inherent to the systems we build. Be Greater Together: We tackle problems no one could solve alone, so we’re here to learn from each other. Each insight is a springboard for the next. We encourage disagreement to achieve a greater outcome. But solving hard problems is only part of the equation—we hire people who inspire us and enjoy working together. The result is a team that truly “clicks”. Do the Right Thing: Building a healthy, lasting company starts from the inside out. Our progressive policies and practices foster transparency, integrity, openness, and forward thinking. We are deeply committed to building a company that empowers people, enables them to thrive throughout their careers, and do big things here.
